# TODO: Update the pypy to the latest version. This is unnecesary for cpython
# because it will be compatible with all newer releases. Changing the versions
# could be convienient in the future, but for now, totally backwards compatible
# wheels work nicely.
#
# Currently, musllinux is left off because Numpy doesn't publish wheels for it
# on PyPI. If you want this package, build it from source. Same for rarer
# architectures, like ppc64le or s390x. You can do this by running the same
# command you run normally:
# pip install dbscan
